Syntax: `notty COMMAND ARGUMENTS`

## üìÅ Saves
Each save has it's HASH which is SHA256 hash. Some commands requires `save_hash` as argument to get into interaction with an save. Full hash has `64` characters but you can use short version of hash which are **first 5 characters** of full hash. When You use `notty list` command and you have some saves saved, you will see a list with hashes in: `(SHORT) FULL` format. You can also type `notty desc <save_hash>` to it's short and full form.
  
## üéØ Todo
Every repository has it's own todo list. Each entry has it's own: 
- `content`: You provide it when todo entry is created.
- `state`: It describes current state of task. Possible values are:
	*  `pending`/`p`/`1`: You have not started this task yet.
	* `in_progress`/`i`/`2`: You are currently working on it.
	* `done`/`finished`/`d`/`f`/`3`: You have done this task.
- `importance`: How important is this task. Possible values are:
	* `low`/`l`/`1`: This task is not important.
	* `medium`/`mid`/`m`/`2`: You should finish this task in short future.
	* `high`/`h`/`!`/`3`: This task is very important and you should finish it ASAP.
- `index`: Dynamically changed discriminator of each task.
